# python-api-challenge

NOTE:  This project uses a forked version of Citipy.

This may run form the include src files but it may conflict if you already have citipy installed in your environment.  See below:

If citipy is already installed, run 'pip uninstall citypy' and then run 'pip install git+https://github.com/Enestvedt/citipy.git@master#egg=citipy'. All else remains the same.

Configs:
Create a config file and and Online Weather Maps API key and Google Maps API. key.  You will need one config file for each sub-project directory.
